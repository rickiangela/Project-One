 * This is a family-friends website that can be used by both parent and child.  
* To begin a parent must register to access the site.  We are using firebase to store the user names, email, passward, child's name and age.

* Once logged in they will come to an acess page where they will see the users on their account.  
* The parent can chose a time the child is allowed to use the site.  Once the time runs out it will default back to the sign-in page.  This will limit the child from getting into the parent's page and changing the settings.

* The parents will have a section that will allow them to search for articles on parenting and have a forum for them to talk with other parents.
* The parent section will also allow the user to edit setting.  Like changing email, password or the child's age.
